# PowerShell Profile

This is my Powershell user profile for Pwsh 5.1+.

I try to keep this as small as possible and use it to load my must have tools.

- [Chocolatey]() init
- run additional helpers on each terminal session except the vscode terminal
- fix some git issues
- set proxy config for node/ electron installer
- Load needed modules like PSReadline and posh-git
- Load starship prompt
